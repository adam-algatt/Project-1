# Project-1 
DISCOVER OREGON
---------------------------------

DESCRIPTION: 

  This application is designed with the traveler in mind even if you live here.  We want the user to input a city of their choice and it will bring up the current 5 day forcast and a list of breweries that they can choose information about (since Oregon is known for beer).  Also, a current ski report for Oregon ski areas and a surf report for major coastal destinations.
